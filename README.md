# hello-world
a short description

This is just a sample repository for me to learn GitHub
I am learning slowly that the things I want to see updated in the world
must be done by me.

I need to take the initiative and go out there and fix things.

I am a performance tester.
Performance testing is an incredibly complex, murky, difficult field.
I listen to NPR while I work sometimes.
